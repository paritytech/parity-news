        "markdown": "It has been all too long since our last release. Some four months have passed since the 1.6 series and over that time we've seen the rise of ETH and BTC, ICO fever hit the streets of Ethereum and an increased presence of Ethereum in the mainstream press. We can finally announce the 1.7 series. Much has gone on behind the scenes to bring you this release and I very much hope you'll enjoy it.\n\nWith the Parity 1.7.0 release we are proud to announce experimental support for light clients and web wallets. The light client can be enabled by starting Parity with the `--light` command-line flag. The web wallet is a public Parity node that keeps the keys and signs transactions using your local browser storage. Try it at [wallet.parity.io](https://wallet.parity.io) or run your own with the `--public-node` flag. An additional important feature is the experimental WASM contract support: As an alternative to the venerable EVM, we can now offer WebAssembly as an alternative runtime for which contracts may be implemented.\n\nTo get an overview of everything included, read the [release accouncement](https://blog.parity.io/announcing-parity-1-7/) on our blog."

        "markdown": "[Kovan](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal) is the community driven test network that runs on the Parity [Aura](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Aura) proof-of-authority consensus engine.\n\nWith a consistent 4 second blocktime, immunity to proof-of-work spam attacks, the network allows developers to develop their applications on a reliable platform. While in an early phase, it already has proven itself to be consistent and available, with all the tools you have come to expect from a testnet ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more, read the original [press release](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/parity-pushes-new-ethereum-testnet-kovan-after-spam-attacks-1609901) or join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/Lobby)."
