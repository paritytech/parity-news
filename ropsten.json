        "markdown": "It has been all too long since our last release. Some four months have passed since the 1.6 series and over that time we've seen the rise of ETH and BTC, ICO fever hit the streets of Ethereum and an increased presence of Ethereum in the mainstream press. We can finally announce the 1.7 series. Much has gone on behind the scenes to bring you this release and I very much hope you'll enjoy it.\n\nWith the Parity 1.7.0 release we are proud to announce experimental support for light clients and web wallets. The light client can be enabled by starting Parity with the `--light` command-line flag. The web wallet is a public Parity node that keeps the keys and signs transactions using your local browser storage. Try it at [wallet.parity.io](https://wallet.parity.io) or run your own with the `--public-node` flag. An additional important feature is the experimental WASM contract support: As an alternative to the venerable EVM, we can now offer WebAssembly as an alternative runtime for which contracts may be implemented.\n\nTo get an overview of everything included, read the [release accouncement](https://blog.parity.io/announcing-parity-1-7/) on our blog."

        "markdown": "We are pleased to [announce](https://github.com/ethereum/ropsten/blob/master/revival.md) that the Ropsten testnet has been revived! Thanks to a generous donation of GPU hashpower, the Ropsten chain has been cleared of the spam blocks that had accumulated in a [recent attack](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/12477).\n\nWhile there is a trend toward adoption of alternative [proof-of-authority](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Proof-of-Authority-Chains) consensus protocols for Ethereum testnets, such as [Kovan](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal), Ropsten as a public proof-of-work Ethereum testnet remains relevant for multiple reasons.\n\nSince the Ethereum mainnet still operates based on PoW consensus, a PoW testnet best reproduces the current production environment, i.e. system and network conditions on the live Ethereum mainnet. Thus, Ropsten is useful for experiments to investigate certain issues that we observe today on the mainnet, such as the relation between uncle rates and gas prices. And for Dapp developers, Ropsten is useful for realistic tests of back-end performance (i.e. mainnet transactions and block times) and front-end user experience.

The [Parity wiki](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki) should be the first stop for any general questions in running the software, configuring it or just trying out some of the basic or advanced features of Parity, either as a user, developer or miner.\n\nIf you prefer direct interaction with the team, join us on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/paritytech/parity) and feel free to ask any questions."
